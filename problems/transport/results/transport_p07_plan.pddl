Assignment numeric effect ((fuel-left truck-1) = 655.000) makes effects on 1 be order-dependent
Assignment numeric effect ((fuel-left truck-2) = 655.000) makes effects on 3 be order-dependent
Assignment numeric effect ((fuel-left truck-3) = 655.000) makes effects on 5 be order-dependent
Assignment numeric effect ((fuel-left truck-4) = 655.000) makes effects on 7 be order-dependent

Assignment numeric effect ((fuel-left truck-1) = 619.000) makes effects on 1 be order-dependent
Assignment numeric effect ((fuel-left truck-2) = 619.000) makes effects on 3 be order-dependent
Assignment numeric effect ((fuel-left truck-3) = 619.000) makes effects on 5 be order-dependent
Assignment numeric effect ((fuel-left truck-4) = 619.000) makes effects on 7 be order-dependent
